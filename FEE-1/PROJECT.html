How can file digital formats like pdf drive so many readers into converting from printed books to downloading e-books? Well, PDF (Portable Document Format) is actually THE most popular on Obooko: it's been our most downloaded book file for novels, nonfiction and textbooks since we opened the site in 2010. In most instances we also provide ePub and Kindle 
versions, so you have three to choose from!
Once you have made your selection from the available free books in our extensive collection, simply click the download button and your free books will transfer direct to your
chosen reading device. It is also comforting to know that there are no adverts, viruses or spammy attachments in our downloads: if you want pdfs, you get 100% clean pdf books, nothing more. 
That goes for ePub pub and Kindle files too!

so you don't have to leave the Obooko website to grab the novels, online story books and nonfiction titles you want.
Using our popular platform means you can browse categories without charge via an incredibly easy-to-navigate, user-friendly online platform compatible across all desktop and 
mobile devices.

and experience how our system works first hand. If you like what you see, you can register (it's free!) which will allow you to log in whenever you wish and get unlimited works without charge. 
There is no limit. Also, you will qualify to give star ratings to authors and send them feedback about the titles you have enjoyed reading.
